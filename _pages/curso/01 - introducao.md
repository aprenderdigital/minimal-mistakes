## Installing the theme

Teste.

If you're running Jekyll v3.5+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem.

### Gem-based method

With Gem-based themes, directories such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files.
